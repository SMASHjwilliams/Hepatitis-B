        <h2>How Math Applies To Hepatitis B</h2>
        <div id="biofont">
            <p> Hello. Our names are Jared Williams, Jada-Nicole Witherspoon and Nasir Duppins. Together as a three person team
                we are working on bettering the community by working on ways to limit the spread of Hepatitis B. We have
                come up with a solution through empathizing with Philadelphian community, defining the problem, ideating
                ideas, prototyping based the on needs of our area, and finally testing. We would like you to implement our
                idea in the philadelphia area.
            </p>
            <p>The impoverished population in Philadelphia has exponentially less than the upper class and henceforth can't
                afford as much. They rely on what is given to them to survive as the wages to the jobs they have not enough
                to be self-sufficient.
            </p>
            <p>We have prototyped needles with disposable tips to be given to the public. Hepatitis B is spread through bodily
                fluid and sharing needles, which is an epidemic throughout the impoverished population of philadelphia. By
                implementing needles with disposable tips sharing needles wouldnâ€™t be a way to spread Hepatitis B. Our PSA
                in addition to our prototype will help people to get vaccinated and lower the amount of people susceptible.
                This eventually leading to herd immunity. Together we could help the community be more informed for Hepatitis
                B and diminish the amount of people who have the virus.
            </p>
